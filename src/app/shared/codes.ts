If the engine control module detects that the voltage in the fuel pump relay main supply circuit is lower than its normal value, it will activate this fault code. At the same time, as with other codes, the engine control indicator light comes on. Other signs of this error code include: fuel pump inactivity, fuel pump inoperative, no start state, and fuel pump operating at all times with the ignition on.",
